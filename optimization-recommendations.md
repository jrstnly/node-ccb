# CCB API Client Optimization Recommendations

## 1. HTTP Client Caching and Reuse
- The `got` HTTP client is currently imported dynamically in multiple places. Consider importing it once at the top level and reusing it.
- The `_client` instance in the `Data` class is already cached, which is good, but the dynamic import could be optimized.

## 2. Error Handling Improvements
- The error handling in the `Data` class's HTTP methods (get, post, put, delete) is very similar. Consider creating a common error handling utility function.
- The error messages in `beforeError` hook could be more structured and consistent.

## 3. Type Safety Enhancements
- There are several places using `any` type (e.g., `_client: any`, `got: any`, `Options: any`, `RequestError: any`). These could be properly typed for better type safety.
- The `config` parameter in the `search` method uses `any` type, which should be properly typed.

## 4. Promise Handling
- The `connect` method in `CCB` class has a potential issue where it might resolve and reject in different code paths. The final `reject` statement might never be reached.
- Consider using async/await consistently instead of mixing Promise chains.

## 5. Memory Management
- The `BehaviorSubject` subscriptions in the constructor don't have cleanup. Consider implementing proper unsubscribe logic.
- File streams in the `upload` method should be properly closed after use.

## 6. Code Duplication
- The HTTP methods in `Data` class (get, post, put, delete) share a lot of similar code. Consider creating a base method to handle common functionality.
- The URL parameter handling could be extracted into a utility function.

## 7. Configuration Management
- The config validation schema could be moved to a separate configuration file for better maintainability.
- Consider using environment variables for sensitive data like client secrets.

## 8. Performance Optimizations
- The token refresh logic could be optimized to prevent multiple simultaneous refresh attempts.
- Consider implementing request batching for multiple API calls.
- The `toString` method in `Data` class creates a new object for each call. Consider memoizing results for frequently used parameters.

## 9. Security Improvements
- Sensitive data like tokens and secrets should be handled more securely.
- Consider implementing rate limiting for API calls.
- Add input validation for all public methods.

## 10. Code Organization
- Consider splitting the `Data` class into smaller, more focused classes (e.g., separate HTTP client, authentication, and file handling).
- Move common utilities to a separate utilities file.

## 11. Documentation
- Add JSDoc comments for public methods and classes.
- Document the expected response formats and error cases.

## 12. Testing Considerations
- The current structure might be difficult to test. Consider adding dependency injection for better testability.
- Add interfaces for external dependencies to make mocking easier.
